Machine learning Udacity Assignments with Python 3 
## K-Means with scikit-learn(Mini project solution)
Clustering is one example of Unsupervised Learning. Unsupervised Learning is something that we want to learn from the datasets, eventhough we don't know what to label this particular data. 
## Support Vector Machines
This is the SVM
  as SVM, it prefer more generalize line separator(the one in the middle), over the other, because the other tend to overfit.
